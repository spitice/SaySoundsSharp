# SaySoundsSharp (modified-pitch-ss)

Example implementation of playing modified pitch saysounds based on faketuna's SaySoundSharp plugin

This plugin adds three additional pitch variations to the existing saysound set (50%, 150%, and 200%).

Tested on the comprehensive saysound set currently used in the latest Lupercalia MG server, which contains approximately 13K items.

However, this system is now obsolete and the prod server is using the new saysound plugin made by Zeisen so keep in mind that this modified SaySoundSharp plugin is only hosted for reference purposes.

More info about the concept is described in here:
