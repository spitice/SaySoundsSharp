#
# Generates sndevts and saysounds.txt files from the directory of mp3 files.
#
# This script traverses your specified saysound directory and collects all .mp3
# files found. It generates a sndevts file that also contains all available
# pitch variations.
#
# Don't bother with the other modifications such as durations, reverb, 3D, and
# Doppler effect for now. Also note that duration is apparently already
# implemented by the new saysound plugin so they don't need to be included in
# the sndevts file anymore.
#
#
# HOW TO USE:
#
# 1. Fill the five file/directory path entries
#    1. cs2Dir
#    2. addonName
#    3. saysoundDir
#    4. outputSndevtsFile (I used a temporary directory for testing purposes.
#       Please change the directory for your own)
#    5. outputSSListFile
# 2. Run the python script
# 3. Copy/move the output sndevts/sslist file to their appropriate location
#
#
# !! CAUTION !! This script does NOT comply with the saysound name escaping rule
# of the new saysound plugin! So, some entries that contain "!" might not be
# played.
#
# Also, the sslist file is customized with the modified SaySoundsSharp so it is
# also not compatible with the new saysound plugin.
#
